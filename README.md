# dbt_sqlite
The files (models, yml, test) I created for the tectalk and where they were located in the standard dbt folder structure.

I didn't push the whole dbt project folder because most of it was not modified and it would be just junk.

For further explanation how to set up dbt locally with SQlite, see the notion link in the presentation PDF :) feel freee to reach me out for any questions!
